# The following property is used by the workstation app to start the local
# rmi registry on the specified port.  This port is intended to be set
# in every one of a workstation app's JVM environment (via System.setProperty),
# so that any client in any of the workstation's app's JVMs
# can look up any remote objects bound to the local rmi registry using
# the java.rmi.Naming service:  Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost:<port>, <name of
# remote object bound in the specified registry> );

# The following entry is for naming the main menu bar.  By default, the menu

# The following theme properties control what the UI will look like.  All
# of the colors of the UI are derived off of the following:

# The system text is the text that is seen in normal controls such as
# comboboxs ( Metal Look and Feel = 102,102,153)
theme.systemtext=#565248
#314e6c

# The control shadow is the shadowing for controls, such as textboxes and
# comboboxs ( Metal Look and Feel = 153,153,204)
theme.controlshadow=#807d74

# The text high light defines the color that will be used when highlighting
# text in a text field. ( Metal Look and Feel = 204,204,255)
theme.textselection=#9db8d2

# Yet another shadow, this represents the normal darker border around a
# control ( Metal Look and Feel = 102,102,102)
theme.controldarkshadow=#565248

# Inactive text will be drawn using this color ( Metal Look and Feel = 153,153,153 )
theme.inactivesystemtext=#807d74

# The regular background of the applications, this is normally 204,204,204
theme.background=#c5c5c5

# Flag to turn on/off the gradient
theme.usegradient=true

# The color used on the left side of the toolbar gradient
theme.gradient.left=#c5c5c5

# The color used on the right side of the toolbar gradient
theme.gradient.right=#000000

# The background of the text fields.  ( Metal Look and Feel = 255,255,255 )
theme.fieldbackground=#FFFDF9

# The text color of controls, etc.  (Metal Look and Feel = 0,0,0 )
theme.usertext=#000000

# Because of some basic limitations in Swing, we are forced to use the
# lighter backgrounds, as opposed to a darker background with lighter
# foregrounds.  This is because some controls use the color.darker() method
# to determine the color.  This is bad if you have a dark background.  The
# colors are determined by taking the HEX value of the color that lies in
# the range of 0-255, which translates to 00-FF.  So, a color of all white
# would read #FFFFFF, since the Red, Green, Blue portions would all be 255.
